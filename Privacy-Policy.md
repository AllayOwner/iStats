# Privacy Policy for iStats

Effective Date: February 24, 2025

## Information We Collect
- **Discord Data**: User tags, server names, and command details (e.g., cust_id or name searched) when you use the /iratingsearch command. This is logged to a designated Discord channel and stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku.
- **iRacing Data**: Temporary retrieval of iRating stats from iRacing APIs, not stored beyond command execution.

## How We Use Your Information
- To provide bot functionality (fetching iRacing stats).
- To track command usage for analytics (e.g., total runs count).
- Data is not shared with third parties except as required by law.

## Data Storage and Security
- Logs are stored in a Discord channel and a Heroku Postgres database with reasonable security measures (e.g., encryption in transit).
- We retain command logs indefinitely unless requested otherwise.

## Your Rights
- You can request data deletion by contacting colbyuhl760@gmail.com. Weâ€™ll remove your command logs from the database where possible.
- Leaving a server with the bot stops further data collection from that context.

## Changes to This Policy
- Updates will be posted here. Continued use after changes implies acceptance.
